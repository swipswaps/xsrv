# xsrv.transmission

This role will install the [Transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(BitTorrent_client)) Bittorrent client. [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) is a [Peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) file sharing network. Transmission allows you to manage torrent downloads from a web interface. Torrents will be downloaded to the server, and can be accessed them using file transfer services (SFTP, Nextcloud...) - also known as a [Seedbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedbox).

## Requirements/Dependencies/example playbook

See [meta/main.yml](meta/main.yml)

```yaml
- hosts: my.example.org
  roles:
    - common # bruteforce protection
    - monitoring # (optional)
    - backup # (optional) automatic backups
    - apache # webserver/reverse proxy, SSL certificates
    - transmission

# ansible-vault edit host_vars/my.example.org/my.example.org.vault.yml
vault_transmission_username: "CHANGEME"
vault_transmission_password: "CHANGEME20"
```

The firewall must allow incoming traffic on `transmission_port` (by default tcp/52943 and udp/52943), and outgoing traffic on all ports. For example using the `common` role:

```yaml
firehol_networks:
  - name: "global"
    ...
    allow_input:
      - ...
      - { name: "transmission", src: "any" }
    allow_output: # outgoing connections
      - ...
      - { name: "all", dst: "any"}
```

See [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) for all configuration variables

Usage
-----

### Backups

See the included [rsnapshot configuration](templates/etc_rsnapshot.d_transmsssion.conf.j2) for the [backup](../backup) role.

Restoring a backup: TODO

### Clients

- The Web interface can be used from a [web browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).
- Downloaded files can be accessed over SFTP (a link to the downloads directory is created in the admin user's home directory).
- If the [nextcloud](../nextcloud) role is installed, you may mount the downloads directory as an [External Storage](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_files/external_storage/local.html) (the nextcloud/`www-data` system user must be added to the `transmission-damon` group) and access downloaded files from nextcloud's web interface.
